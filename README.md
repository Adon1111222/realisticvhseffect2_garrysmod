Real time VHS effect for the game Garry's mod

This is a completely new version of the old addon.
A separate menu has been added, the OSD system has been completely rewrited, which now supports customized time layout and fixed digits size.
This addon currently only emulates a PAL video system with 720x576 resolution and 25 f-fps.
Based on real videotape captures.

# Editing
The code may initially seem a bit confusing, but i split it into two files(core and menu) which makes it a bit easier to read.
Also, for your convenience, all variables have been moved to the global environment, you can edit them via LUA.
